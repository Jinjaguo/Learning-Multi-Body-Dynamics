# Learning-Multi-Body-Dynamics
## Simulator-Augmented Interaction Networks (SAIN) for Proxy Pushing  
Learn and model the dynamics of an agent pushing a target object, and use it to plan a control strategy to make the target object reach the target position   

## Motivation
In some tasks, we are not able to directly manipulate the desired object but we can use other objects as a proxy to interact with the desired object. Here, the proposed extension experimental setup is similar to [Ajay et al., ICRA, 2019], where we push an object to the goal by using an intermediate object.   
The robot will push this intermediate object into contact with the target object, and plan for a sequence of actions such that the interaction between the two will drive the target object to its goal.

> **Task**: Use a Franka Panda arm to push a **middle object**  as a proxy tool to indirectly drive a **target object**  into a green goal region.    
> **Approach**: Re-implement Ajay *et al.* ICRA 2019‚Äôs **Simulator-Augmented Interaction Network (SAIN)** combined with **MPPI** for closed-loop control in PyBullet.
